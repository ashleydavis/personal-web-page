# Data Wrangling with JavaScript

My book [Data Wrangling with JavaScript](http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2) is a comprehensive overview of working with data in JavaScript. Please let your friends and collegues know about it!

# Data-Forge and Data-Forge Notebook

[Data-Forge](http://www.data-forge-js.com) is my open-source data transformation and analysis toolkit for JavaScript/TypeScript. It is inspired by Pandas and LINQ and is my goto tool for slicing and dicing data. 

[Data-Forge Notebook](http://data-forge-notebook.com/) is my notebook-style desktop app for data analysis, transformation and visualization in JavaScript and TypeScript (kind of like an IDE for working with data). [Check out the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO1J1G_A3d8).

# Bio

I have a long history in software development with many years in apps, web apps, backends, serious games, simulations and VR. I make  technology work for business. I architect and build bespoke software solutions that span multiple platforms.

I have years of experience managing development teams, preparing technical strategies and creation of software products. I can explain complicated technology to senior management. I have delivered cutting-edge products in fast-paced and high-pressure environments. I know how to focus and prioritize to get the important things done. 

I am a passionate technologist and agile practitioner. I have had great success with TDD and am convinced of its ability to produce better code that stabilizes more quickly while being evolved rapidly. I'm a fan of functional programming principles and their potential for safety, predictability & concurrency. 

I contribute to open source and have founded multiple industry groups.

[Please find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleydavis75/) for my full history.

# Open-source

I have plenty of open-source code available on my [personal Github](https://github.com/ashleydavis), [the Data-Forge org](https://github.com/data-forge/) and [the Grademark org](https://github.com/grademark/). 

I also did open-source work while at Real Serious Games, you'll find some very useful code for working with Unity and Node.js on [the Real Serious Games Github org](https://github.com/real-serious-games).

# Quantitative and algorithmic trading

I'm a keen systematic trader, currently trading stocks on the ASX and exploring quantiative and algorithmic trading strategies.


I created a stock market simulator called [Market Wizard](https://www.market-wizard.com.au/) which has a small, but loyal following. 

These days I mostly test trading strategies through backtesting because papertrading is too slow. I have built extensive personal software for this purpose. I am slowly open-sourcing my backtesting code under [the Grademark org](https://github.com/grademark/). 


# Blogs

I have two blogs.

[The Data Wrangler](http://www.the-data-wrangler.com/) is my current blog - with writings on data analysis and general coding.

[What could possibly go wrong?](http://www.what-could-possibly-go-wrong.com/) is my older game tech blog, I no longer update this - but it's preserved for posterity and to occasionaly remind myself of just much I have written.
