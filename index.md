# Data Wrangling with JavaScript

My book [Data Wrangling with JavaScript](http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2) is live! If you are interested in data transformation, analysis and visualization please grab a copy. If not, please help me promote it! Want to give feedback? See my email address at the bottom of the page.

# Bio

I have a long history in software development with many years in apps, web apps, backends, serious games, simulations and VR. I make  technology work for business. I architect and build bespoke software solutions that span multiple platforms.

I have years of experience managing development teams, preparing technical strategies and creation of software products. I can explain complicated technology to senior management. I have delivered cutting-edge products in fast-paced and high-pressure environments. I know how to focus and prioritize to get the important things done. 

I am a passionate technologist and agile practitioner. I have had great success with TDD and am convinced of its ability to produce better code that stabilizes more quickly while being evolved rapidly. I'm a fan of functional programming and its potential for safety, predictability & concurrency. 

I contribute to open source and have founded multiple industry groups.

I'm also a keen systems trader, currently trading stocks on the ASX and building algorithmic strategies for CFDs trading.

[Please find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleydavis75/) for the full list of employment history, projects and publications.

# Data-Forge

Data-Forge is my open-source data transformation and analysis toolkit for JavaScript/TypeScript. It is inspired by Pandas and LINQ and is my goto tool for slicing and dicing data.

Read more about it on my blog [The Data Wrangler](http://www.the-data-wrangler.com/data-forge-v1-launch/).

You can [find Data-Forge on Github](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts) or take a look at [the official Data-Forge landing page](http://www.data-forge-js.com/).

# Other open-source

I have plenty of other open source code on my [personal Github account](https://github.com/ashleydavis). Please have a browse. If something looks interesting, but isn't well documented, please reach out and let me know about it!

I also did a lot of open-source work while at Real Serious Games, you'll find some very useful code for work with Unity and Node.js on the [Real Serious Games Github account](https://github.com/real-serious-games).

# Market Wizard

I've created a stock market simulator called [Market Wizard](https://www.market-wizard.com.au/) which has a small, but loyal following. 

I use this for my own paper trading, although mostly now I do backtesting because paper trading is too slow and only useful once a trading strategy has passed through many rounds of historical and statistical testing.

# Blogs

I have two blogs.

[The Data Wrangler](http://www.the-data-wrangler.com/) is my current blog - with writings on data analysis and general coding.

[What could possibly go wrong?](http://www.what-could-possibly-go-wrong.com/) is my older game tech blog, I no longer update this - but it's preserved for posterity and to occasionaly remind myself of just much I have written.
